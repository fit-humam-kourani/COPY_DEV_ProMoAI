The process begins when a customer files a complaint about a product or service. Customer service logs the complaint and assigns it to the relevant department for investigation. After reviewing the details, the team determines whether the complaint is valid and whether a refund is justified. If a refund is approved, the financial team processes the reimbursement and notifies the customer. The complaint is marked as resolved, and the case is closed once the customer receives the refund and confirms satisfaction.

This process starts with a department outlining its objectives for the upcoming period, such as hiring, equipment needs, or marketing efforts. The team drafts a plan that includes cost estimates and justifications for the budget requested. The finance department reviews the plan and assesses its alignment with organizational goals. After negotiation and possible adjustments, a final budget is approved and allocated to the department. The process ends when the budget is distributed, and the department begins implementing its plan.

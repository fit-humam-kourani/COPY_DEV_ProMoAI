This process kicks off when a department identifies the need for a new hire. HR creates a job description and posts it on job boards. Resumes are collected and screened, followed by initial phone interviews. Selected candidates are invited for in-person or virtual interviews. Once a candidate is chosen, an offer is extended, and salary negotiations may take place. After the offer is accepted, the onboarding process begins, including paperwork, orientation, and training. The process concludes once the new hire is fully integrated into the team and has access to all necessary tools and resources.

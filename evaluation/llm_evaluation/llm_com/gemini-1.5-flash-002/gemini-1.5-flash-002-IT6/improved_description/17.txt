An e-commerce company has a comprehensive order fulfillment process:  The process begins when a customer places an order, triggering the system to record order details.  Payment processing is then initiated. There is an exclusive choice between successful payment processing and payment failure. If payment fails, the customer receives a notification, and the process ends. Upon successful payment, the inventory system checks stock availability for all ordered items. There is an exclusive choice between all items being in stock and one or more items being out of stock. If items are out of stock, a back-order is initiated for the out-of-stock items, and the customer is informed of the delay. The process is then paused, resuming only after the back-ordered items are received and all ordered items are available in stock.  If all items are in stock, the in-stock items are picked from the warehouse.  Quality control checks are performed on the picked items.  Packaging is initiated, including gift wrapping if requested by the customer. Concurrently, the shipping department prepares shipping documents and labels. If the order is international, customs documentation is also prepared. Once packaging is complete and all shipping documents are ready, the order is dispatched. A shipping confirmation is sent to the customer.  After dispatch, the system updates the inventory levels. A follow-up email requesting feedback is sent to the customer after the delivery is confirmed. There is an exclusive choice between the customer reporting no issues and the customer reporting issues upon delivery. If the customer reports issues, a returns process is initiated, involving the following sequential steps: sending a return shipping label, receiving returned items, inspecting returned items, and processing a refund or replacement.

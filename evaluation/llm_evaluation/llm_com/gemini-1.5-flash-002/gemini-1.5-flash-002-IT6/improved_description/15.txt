The process initiates when a company schedules a compliance audit, specifying the relevant regulations (e.g., ISO standards, safety protocols, environmental guidelines).  Internal teams then commence preparation activities, which include documentation preparation, evidence gathering, and a self-assessment.  Following the internal preparation phase, an external audit is conducted.  During the external audit, auditors review company processes and identify any non-conformances or areas for improvement.  A remediation phase follows, where the company addresses the identified non-conformances. This may involve corrective actions and/or preventative actions. Subsequently, a final audit is performed to verify the effectiveness of the remediation. If all audit criteria are met during the final audit, the company is awarded certification. The process concludes with the issuance of official certification documents.

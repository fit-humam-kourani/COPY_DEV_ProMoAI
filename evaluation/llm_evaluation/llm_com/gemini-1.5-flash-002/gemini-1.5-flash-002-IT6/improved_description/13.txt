The process initiates when a customer submits a complaint regarding a product or service.  A customer service representative logs the complaint into the complaint management system, recording details such as customer identification, product/service involved, and nature of the complaint. The complaint is then assigned to the appropriate department based on predefined routing rules. The assigned department reviews the complaint details and supporting documentation.  The department determines the validity of the complaint. This determination results in one of two outcomes: the complaint is deemed valid, or the complaint is deemed invalid. If valid, the department assesses whether a refund is justified based on established criteria. The customer is notified of the decision regarding the complaint's validity and the refund eligibility. If a refund is approved, the complaint and related information are forwarded to the financial department for processing. The financial department processes the refund, which includes verifying customer information and initiating the reimbursement. Once the refund is processed and the customer receives confirmation, or if a refund is denied and the customer is notified, the complaint is marked as resolved within the complaint management system.  Following resolution, the customer is offered an optional satisfaction survey to provide feedback on the handling of their complaint.

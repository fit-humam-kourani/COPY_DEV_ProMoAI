This process initiates when a department submits a new hire requisition.  HR receives the requisition and creates a job description, specifying required skills, experience, and responsibilities.  This job description is then posted to pre-approved job boards.  Resumes are collected and screened based on pre-defined criteria.  A subset of candidates is selected for initial phone screenings.  Following the phone screenings, a further subset of candidates is invited to participate in in-person or virtual interviews, the mode being determined by candidate preference and HR's logistical constraints.  A candidate is selected. A job offer is extended, including a salary and benefits package.  Salary negotiations may optionally occur following the extension of the offer.  Upon acceptance of the offer, the onboarding process commences. The onboarding process includes completion of required paperwork, a formal orientation session, and a structured training program. The process concludes upon successful completion of all onboarding steps and confirmation of the new hire's integration into the team.

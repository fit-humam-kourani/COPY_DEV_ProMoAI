This process begins with the monitoring of inventory levels in a warehouse or store.  A predefined inventory threshold triggers either an automated alert or a manual check, signaling the need to reorder.  This initiates the order placement process. The procurement team places an order with a supplier, considering factors such as cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability.  Supplier selection may involve a decision based on these factors. Following order placement, the inventory management system updates with the expected delivery date. Upon receipt of the stock, a quality inspection is performed.  Successful inspection leads to recording the stock in the inventory management system and placement on shelves or in storage; otherwise, the stock is rejected, and the process may loop back to the order placement step with a new supplier. The process concludes with the update of inventory levels to reflect the restocked quantity.

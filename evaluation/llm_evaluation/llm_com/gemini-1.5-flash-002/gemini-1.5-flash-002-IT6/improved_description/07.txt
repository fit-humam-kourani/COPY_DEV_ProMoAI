This process initiates when a customer initiates a search for a flight, train, or bus ticket within the booking system.  The customer selects their preferred route, specifying origin, destination, date, and time of travel. Following route selection, the customer provides necessary personal information, including name, contact details, and potentially other identifying information, as required by the booking system and relevant regulations. Subsequently, the customer enters their payment details, selecting from available payment methods.  Upon successful payment verification, the booking system generates a unique ticket containing all relevant travel details. This ticket is then delivered to the customer electronically via email or SMS, as selected by the customer during the booking process. Concurrently, the travel company's seat inventory is updated to reflect the newly booked seat(s).  Prior to the scheduled travel date, the customer may receive automated reminders and instructions pertaining to check-in procedures, boarding gates (if applicable), or other relevant pre-travel information. The process formally concludes upon completion of the customer's journey.  Optionally, post-travel feedback mechanisms or the provision of additional services may extend customer interaction beyond the formal completion of the journey.

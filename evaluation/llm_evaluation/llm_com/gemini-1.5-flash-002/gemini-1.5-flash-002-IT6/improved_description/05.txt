The process initiates when a need for a new supplier or vendor is identified by the company.  The procurement team then issues a request for proposals (RFP). Following RFP issuance, the team receives proposals from various suppliers.  Each received proposal undergoes evaluation based on pre-defined criteria including, but not limited to, cost, quality, and delivery time.  The evaluation may optionally include site visits or interviews with shortlisted suppliers.  After the completion of proposal analysis, a supplier is selected.  Contract negotiations then commence between the selected supplier and the company.  Upon reaching mutual agreement on all contract terms, the contract is signed by both parties. The process concludes with the onboarding of the selected supplier and the commencement of contract execution.

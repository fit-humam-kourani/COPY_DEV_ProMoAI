The process initiates when an employee or department submits a request for an IT solution, specifying the required software or hardware.  This request is then assessed by the IT department. The assessment includes a compatibility check against existing systems and an evaluation of the associated costs and resource requirements.  Following the assessment, a decision is made: either the request is approved or rejected.  If approved, the IT department procures the necessary tools or licenses. Subsequently, the IT department installs the solution and conducts testing within a controlled environment.  A successful test result triggers deployment of the new solution to the requesting department.  Post-deployment, training may be provided to the requesting department. Finally, ongoing IT support is available for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

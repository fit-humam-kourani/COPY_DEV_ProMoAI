This process initiates when a customer submits an order via the online platform or telephone.  The system automatically generates and transmits an order confirmation to the customer. Subsequently, the warehouse team executes order picking and packing activities.  A shipping label is then generated.  The packaged order is then transferred to a designated logistics provider for shipment.  Tracking information is subsequently provided to the customer.  The process continues with shipment monitoring until delivery to the customer's address is confirmed. Upon successful delivery, the process concludes.  However, the receipt of customer feedback or a return request will initiate subsequent processes.

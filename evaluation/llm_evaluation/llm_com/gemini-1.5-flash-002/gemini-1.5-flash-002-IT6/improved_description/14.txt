This process begins with a department outlining its objectives for the upcoming period, specifying details such as hiring targets (number of positions, required skills), equipment needs (type of equipment, quantity, cost estimates), and marketing efforts (specific campaigns, target audience, projected reach).  The department then drafts a detailed budget plan that includes specific cost estimates for each objective, along with justifications for each budget request, providing supporting data and rationale. This plan is submitted to a strategic alignment meeting where it is reviewed to ensure alignment with broader organizational goals and strategic priorities.  Following the strategic alignment meeting, the finance department performs a detailed review of the budget plan, assessing its feasibility against organizational financial constraints and established budgetary guidelines.  This review may involve multiple iterations.  Following each review, the plan may undergo adjustments; each adjustment is documented, including the reason for the change and the responsible stakeholder.  Each adjustment requires approval from relevant stakeholders, such as departmental managers and finance representatives.  The plan proceeds through these iterative review and adjustment cycles until a final approved version is reached. Once the final budget plan is approved by all necessary stakeholders, the budget is officially allocated to the department. The process concludes with the distribution of the allocated budget to the department, enabling them to begin implementing their plan.

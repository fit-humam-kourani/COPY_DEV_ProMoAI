At The Evanstonian hotel, a room service order begins when a guest calls. The room service manager receives the order details and generates two order tickets: one for the kitchen to prepare the food, and another for the sommelier to retrieve wine and prepare alcoholic beverages from the cellar.  There is an exclusive choice between including alcoholic beverages in the order or not, with alcoholic beverages being included in approximately 80% of orders. Concurrently, the room service manager assigns the order to a waiter. While the kitchen and sommelier fulfill their respective tasks, the waiter prepares a room service cart (placing a tablecloth and gathering silverware) and prepares any non-alcoholic beverages specified in the order. Once the food, wine (if applicable), and non-alcoholic drinks are ready, and the cart is prepared, the waiter delivers the order to the guest's room. Upon returning to the room service station, the waiter debits the guest's account; there is an exclusive choice between debiting the account immediately or delaying this task if the waiter has another order to prepare or deliver.

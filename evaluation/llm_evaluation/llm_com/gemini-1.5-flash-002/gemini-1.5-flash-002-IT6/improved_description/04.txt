The process initiates with the definition of marketing campaign objectives, specifying the target audience and quantifiable goals such as lead generation or brand awareness increase.  This is followed by the creation of marketing materials, encompassing content development, visual design, and selection of promotional channels.  Channel selection includes a choice between digital advertising, email marketing, and social media posting, or any combination thereof. The campaign is then launched.  Real-time performance monitoring is implemented, tracking key metrics including, but not limited to, click-through rates and conversion rates. Leads generated are captured and stored within the CRM system for subsequent sales team follow-up. Upon campaign conclusion, a comprehensive performance analysis is conducted to inform future campaign optimization strategies.

The process begins with the user logging in to their online shop account.  Following login, the user concurrently selects items for purchase and designates a payment method. Subsequently, the user chooses between two mutually exclusive options: paying for the order in full or establishing an installment agreement.  After item selection, but independently of payment processing, the user selects a free reward from multiple available options. The reward selection is contingent upon the total purchase value.  Once payment is processed (via either full payment or installment agreement), the items are delivered to the user.  The user has the option to return items for exchange; each item return initiates a new delivery process.

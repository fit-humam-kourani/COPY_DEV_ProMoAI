The process begins with the identification of a new product idea or an improvement to an existing product.  This initiates an initial research and feasibility study phase conducted by the R&D team.  The output of this phase is a set of design concepts.  A design concept is selected based on predefined criteria. Following the selection of a promising design concept, a prototype is constructed using available materials and resources. This prototype then undergoes a testing phase encompassing functionality, safety, and market potential assessments. Feedback is collected from this testing phase.  There is an exclusive choice between proceeding to a prototype refinement phase or proceeding directly to the final decision phase based on the test results. If refinement is deemed necessary, the prototype is revised, and the testing phase is repeated. The process concludes with a decision to either approve the prototype for further development or discard it.

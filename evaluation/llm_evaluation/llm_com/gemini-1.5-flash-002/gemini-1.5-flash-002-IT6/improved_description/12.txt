This process initiates with the identification of an employee's development needs or career aspirations.  This identification may involve input from the employee, their manager, and/or HR. The manager and HR then collaboratively create a personalized development plan (PDP). The PDP outlines specific development activities, which may include, but are not limited to, participation in formal training programs, assignment to a mentor, or delegation of additional responsibilities.  The employee actively engages in these development activities.  During this phase, the employee receives ongoing feedback and performance evaluations from their supervisors.  Upon successful completion of predefined milestones within the PDP, the employee is considered for a promotion or a new role.  HR conducts a formal performance review, assessing the employee's achievement of the PDP milestones and overall performance.  If the review is positive and the promotion is approved, the promotion is finalized, including the assignment of new responsibilities and any associated compensation adjustments. The process concludes with the employee's transition into their new role.

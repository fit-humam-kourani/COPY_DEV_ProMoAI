This process begins when an employee or customer submits an incident report via [Specify reporting method, e.g., online form, phone call, email].  The report, containing details such as [Specify required details, e.g., date, time, location, description of incident, reporter contact information], is logged into the incident tracking system [Specify system name, if applicable]. The system automatically assigns the report to the appropriate team based on [Specify assignment criteria, e.g., incident type, location, predefined team assignments].  The assigned team then gathers necessary information from [Specify information sources, e.g., the reporter, affected systems, on-site inspections]. This information gathering may involve multiple steps and interviews.  Next, the team analyzes the gathered information to identify the root cause of the incident.  Based on the root cause analysis, the team proposes corrective actions, which are reviewed and approved by [Specify approver/approval process]. The approved solution is implemented; this may involve a technical fix, employee training, a policy change, or a combination thereof.  Following implementation, a verification step confirms successful resolution of the incident. A follow-up process is initiated to monitor for recurrence of the issue. This involves [Specify follow-up activities, e.g., scheduled check-ins, data analysis, regular system monitoring]. The incident report is closed after the follow-up is complete and all stakeholders, including [Specify stakeholders, e.g., reporter, team members, management], are notified of the closure.

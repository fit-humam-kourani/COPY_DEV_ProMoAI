The annual audit process in a multinational company begins when the audit coordinator initiates the process by sending a notification to the regional office.  The regional office then prepares financial statements and gathers necessary supporting documents. Concurrently, the compliance team checks for any relevant regulatory updates. Following the completion of document preparation and regulatory checks, the regional office submits all documents to the central audit team. The central audit team reviews the submitted documents.  A decision point is reached: if discrepancies are found, the central audit team requests clarifications from the regional office; otherwise, the process proceeds to the next step. The regional office provides clarifications as needed. Once all documents are reviewed and deemed complete and accurate, the central audit team performs a risk assessment, evaluating financial, operational, and compliance risks. The order of these risk evaluations is flexible, but all three must be completed.  A decision point is reached: if high risk is identified, a detailed investigation is launched, encompassing data analysis, interviews, and, in some cases, site visits; otherwise, the process proceeds. After all identified risks are addressed, the audit team compiles the audit report. This report is then reviewed by the audit director. The audit director either approves the report or requests revisions. If revisions are requested, the audit team updates the report and resubmits it for review by the audit director. This forms a loop until the audit director approves the report. Once approved, the final audit report is distributed to the executive board and archived, formally closing the audit process.

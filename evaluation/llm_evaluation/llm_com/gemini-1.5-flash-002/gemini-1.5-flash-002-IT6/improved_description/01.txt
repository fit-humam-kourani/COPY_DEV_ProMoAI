This process initiates when a potential customer inquiry regarding a product or service is received.  Sales staff or customer support personnel collect relevant customer information, addressing any inquiries or concerns.  Following this information gathering, a decision point is reached: if the customer expresses interest, the process proceeds; otherwise, the process terminates.  If interested, the customer is guided through the product or service selection process. Subsequently, the sales representative generates a quote. Upon customer approval of the quote, the process transitions to order placement.  The order is then recorded within the system, and an order confirmation is provided to the customer. The process concludes upon successful order placement and confirmation.

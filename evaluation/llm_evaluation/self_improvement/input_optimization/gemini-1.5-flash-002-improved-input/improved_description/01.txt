This process initiates upon receipt of a customer inquiry regarding a product or service.  A sales representative or customer support agent collects necessary customer information, addressing any questions or concerns.  This initial interaction is followed by an exclusive choice (XOR): either the customer expresses interest and proceeds to product/service selection, guided by the sales representative, or the customer does not express interest, and the process terminates. If interest is expressed, the sales representative provides a price quotation. Customer approval of the quotation is required; this approval triggers the order placement sub-process. The order placement sub-process involves recording the order in the system and sending an order confirmation to the customer. The process concludes successfully upon order placement and confirmation.  A failure at any stage may result in process termination.

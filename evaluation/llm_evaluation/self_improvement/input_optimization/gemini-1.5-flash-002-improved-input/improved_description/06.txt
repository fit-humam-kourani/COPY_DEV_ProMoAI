This process initiates when a customer submits an order, via online platform or phone.  The system generates and sends an order confirmation to the customer.  A partial order begins, encompassing: (1) Warehouse picking and packing of order items; (2) Generation of shipping label.  These two activities may occur concurrently or sequentially, depending on warehouse workflow. Following completion of both activities, the order is transferred to a logistics provider for delivery. The system generates and sends tracking information to the customer.  A loop begins:  The system monitors shipment progress until delivery is confirmed at the customer's address (do-part).  If a delivery exception occurs, requiring intervention (e.g., failed delivery attempt), the system attempts redelivery (redo-part).  This loop continues until successful delivery. Upon successful delivery, the main process concludes. An XOR construct follows:  Either customer feedback is solicited and processed, or a return process is initiated, depending on customer action.

An e-commerce company's order fulfillment process begins when a customer places an order, triggering order detail recording.  Payment processing then commences.  This is followed by an XOR construct: if payment fails, the customer is notified, and the process terminates; otherwise, the process continues.  Upon successful payment, the inventory system checks stock availability. An XOR construct is used here: if items are out of stock, a back-order is initiated, the customer is informed of the delay, and the process enters a LOOP construct. The LOOP's do-part consists of checking stock availability; the redo-part involves waiting for and receiving the back-order. The loop terminates when all items are in stock.  For in-stock items, a partial order begins encompassing item picking from the warehouse, quality control checks, and packaging (including optional gift wrapping if requested by the customer).  Concurrently, the shipping department prepares shipping documents and labels.  If the order is international (XOR construct), customs documentation is also prepared.  Once packaging and shipping document preparation are complete (partial order completion), the order is dispatched. A shipping confirmation is sent to the customer.  Inventory levels are updated.  A follow-up email requesting feedback is sent upon confirmed delivery. If the customer reports issues (XOR construct), a returns process is initiated, consisting of: sending a return shipping label, receiving returned items, inspecting returned items, and processing a refund or replacement (this is a sequential process).

University Enrollment Process:

The process begins with a prospective student submitting an online application.  The admissions office then reviews the application and supporting documents.  This review includes a check for completeness.  An XOR construct governs the subsequent step:  If documents are missing, the applicant is notified and must resubmit; otherwise, the application proceeds.  Upon receiving all required documents, the admissions committee evaluates the application.  Concurrently, the finance department processes application fees or waivers.  An XOR construct determines the next step based on the admissions committee's decision:  If accepted, an acceptance letter is sent; otherwise, a rejection letter is sent, and the process ends for that applicant.

If accepted, a LOOP construct begins, iterating per semester until graduation or withdrawal.  Within the loop's "do" part, the student must confirm enrollment by a specified deadline; otherwise, the application is canceled, and the loop terminates.  If confirmed, the student receives orientation materials, and the IT department sets up student accounts.  If the student is international, a concurrent process begins in which the international student office assists with visa processing.

Following account setup and (if applicable) visa processing, the student obtains a student ID card and begins creating their study plan, which includes meeting with an academic advisor, selecting courses, and resolving any schedule conflicts.  The student then begins attending classes.

The "redo" part of the semester LOOP comprises the add/drop period, during which the student may add or drop courses. At the end of the semester, grades are posted, and the student can review them. An XOR construct handles grievances: If the student has grievances, they may file an appeal, which involves submitting an appeal form, meeting with the appeals committee, and awaiting a decision.  The loop then iterates to the next semester.

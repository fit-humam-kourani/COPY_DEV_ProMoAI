The process initiates upon scheduling a compliance audit for regulations (e.g., ISO standards, safety protocols, environmental guidelines).  This triggers a parallel process involving internal team documentation preparation, evidence gathering, and a self-assessment.  Following this parallel phase, an external audit is conducted where auditors review company processes and identify gaps or issues.  A corrective action phase then occurs, involving remediation of identified gaps and improvements to processes. This is followed by a final audit.  The final audit outcome determines the process conclusion:  If all criteria are met, certification is awarded and official documents are issued; otherwise, the process may loop back to the corrective action phase, with the redo part focusing on addressing the remaining issues identified in the final audit, before repeating the final audit.

The process initiates with the identification of a new product idea or an improvement to an existing product.  This is followed by an initial research and feasibility study conducted by the R&D team, resulting in the drafting of design concepts.  A selection process then chooses a single promising design concept from the drafted concepts. This selection is followed by the construction of a prototype using available materials and resources.  The prototype then undergoes a series of tests to assess its functionality, safety, and market potential.  Feedback is collected from the testing phase.  A decision is made to either approve the prototype for further development or to discard it. If the prototype requires refinement based on the test feedback, a loop is initiated: a refinement process is executed, followed by a reiteration of the testing phase.  This loop continues until the prototype is deemed acceptable for further development or is discarded. The final decision (approve or discard) marks the end of the process.

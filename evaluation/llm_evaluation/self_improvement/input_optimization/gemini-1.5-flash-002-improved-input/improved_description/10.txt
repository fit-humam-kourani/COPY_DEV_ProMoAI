The process initiates upon submission of an IT solution request (software, hardware, etc.) by an employee or department.  This request undergoes an assessment by the IT department, encompassing compatibility checks with existing systems and evaluation of associated costs and resource requirements. This assessment results in an approval or rejection decision.  If approved, a procurement phase commences, involving the acquisition of necessary tools or licenses.  Following procurement, the solution is installed and undergoes testing within a controlled environment. Successful completion of testing triggers deployment to the requesting department. Post-deployment, optional training may be provided.  Finally, ongoing IT support is made available for troubleshooting and issue resolution.  Rejection of the request concludes the process.

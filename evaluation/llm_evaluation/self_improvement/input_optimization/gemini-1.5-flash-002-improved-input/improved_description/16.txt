The annual audit process begins when the audit coordinator initiates the process by sending a notification to the regional office.  The regional office then prepares financial statements and gathers necessary documents.  This is done concurrently with the compliance team checking for any regulatory updates affecting the audit. Following this concurrent phase, the regional office submits the prepared documents to the central audit team. The central audit team reviews the submitted documents.  There is an XOR choice: either discrepancies are found, resulting in a request for clarifications from the regional office, followed by the regional office providing those clarifications; or no discrepancies are found, proceeding directly to the next step. Once all documents are reviewed without further issues, the central audit team conducts a risk assessment. This risk assessment involves evaluating financial, operational, and compliance risks.  These risk evaluations may be performed concurrently as a partial order (any order, but all must complete). If high risk is identified during the risk assessment, a detailed investigation is launched.  This investigation includes data analysis, interviews, and, in certain cases, site visits. After all risks are addressed, the audit team compiles the audit report. The report is reviewed by the audit director. There is a LOOP construct: the audit director either approves the report, leading to distribution to the executive board and archiving, and finally process closure; or sends the report back for revisions, leading to the audit team updating the report and resubmitting it for review by the audit director (repeating the do-part of the loop).

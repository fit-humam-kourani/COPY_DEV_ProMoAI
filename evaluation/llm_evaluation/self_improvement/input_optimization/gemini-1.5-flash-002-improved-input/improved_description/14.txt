This process begins with a department outlining its objectives for the upcoming period, specifying details such as hiring targets, equipment requirements (including quantity, specifications, and vendor information), and marketing strategies (including target audience, campaign details, and projected ROI).  The team then drafts a comprehensive plan, including detailed cost estimates for each objective, justifications for each budget request, and a timeline for implementation. This plan undergoes a strategic alignment review meeting to ensure congruence with overarching organizational goals.  This review may result in a decision to revise the plan. Following the strategic alignment review, the finance department performs a detailed feasibility review of the budget, assessing its alignment with financial projections and resource availability.  This review may necessitate multiple iterations of plan revisions and approvals.  Each revision undergoes a loop consisting of a do-part (adjustment of the plan based on feedback) and a redo-part (review of the adjusted plan by relevant stakeholders). This loop continues until the plan is approved.  The approval of the final plan triggers the allocation of the budget to the department.  The process concludes with the distribution of the allocated budget and the commencement of plan implementation.

The process initiates upon identification of a need for a new supplier or vendor by the company.  The procurement team then issues a request for proposals (RFP).  Following RFP issuance, responses are received from various suppliers.  A loop begins, iterating through each received proposal.  Within this loop, a partial order executes:  Each proposal undergoes evaluation based on pre-defined criteria (cost, quality, delivery time).  Concurrently, optional site visits or supplier interviews may be conducted. The loop concludes after all proposals have been processed.  An XOR construct follows: either a supplier is selected, proceeding to contract negotiations; or, if no suitable supplier is found, the process returns to the initial supplier identification step.  Contract negotiations commence upon supplier selection.  Once mutual agreement on contractual terms is reached, the contract is signed. The process concludes with the official onboarding of the selected supplier and contract execution.

The process initiates when a customer submits a complaint regarding a product or service.  Customer service personnel log the complaint, assigning it to the appropriate department for investigation.  The assigned department reviews the complaint details. This review determines whether the complaint is valid.  An XOR construct then determines the next step: either a refund is justified, or it is not.  If a refund is justified, the system proceeds to a sub-process where the financial team processes the reimbursement.  If a refund is not justified, this sub-process is skipped.  A notification is sent to the customer, communicating the decision regarding the complaint. Subsequently, a partial order is established. The complaint is marked as resolved. This resolution occurs after the customer receives the refund (if applicable) and after the customer notification.  Finally, a post-resolution feedback mechanism allows customers to provide feedback on their satisfaction with the resolution process.

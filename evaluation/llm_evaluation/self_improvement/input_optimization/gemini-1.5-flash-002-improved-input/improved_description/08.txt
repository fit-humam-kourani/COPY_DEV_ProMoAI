This process begins when an incident report is submitted by an employee or customer, detailing a technical issue or workplace safety concern.  The report is logged into a tracking system, triggering an assignment to the appropriate investigation team.  The team initiates information gathering, which may involve multiple parallel activities such as interviewing witnesses, reviewing documentation, and analyzing system logs. Following information gathering, the team identifies the root cause of the incident. Based on the root cause, the team proposes corrective actions. This may involve an exclusive choice between implementing a technical fix, conducting employee training, or modifying existing policies.  The chosen corrective action is implemented.  A follow-up activity is then performed to verify the effectiveness of the implemented solution and assess the risk of recurrence.  There is a loop encompassing the follow-up and a potential re-investigation (redo part) if the issue persists.  The incident report is closed after the issue is resolved and all stakeholders are notified, signaling the end of the process.

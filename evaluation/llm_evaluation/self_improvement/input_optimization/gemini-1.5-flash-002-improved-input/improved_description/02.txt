This process initiates when a department submits a new hire requisition.  HR then creates a job description and posts it to designated job boards.  Subsequently, resumes are collected and screened.  This is followed by a selection process where candidates undergo initial phone screenings.  A subset of candidates is then selected for in-person or virtual interviews, the choice determined by candidate preference. This selection process may involve multiple rounds of interviews.  Following the interviews, a candidate is chosen.  A job offer is extended, and salary negotiations may or may not occur.  If an offer is accepted, the onboarding process begins. The onboarding process includes required paperwork completion, orientation, and initial training. The onboarding process also includes a period of team integration activities, such as mentoring and project assignments.  Upon successful completion of all onboarding steps, the new hire is considered fully integrated into the team, and the process concludes.

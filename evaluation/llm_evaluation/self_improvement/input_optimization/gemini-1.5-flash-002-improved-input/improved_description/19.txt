The online shopping process begins with the user logging in.  This is followed by a parallel execution of selecting items and setting a payment method.  After item selection, there is an XOR choice between paying for the order and entering into an installment agreement.  Following item selection, but independent of the payment process, the user chooses a free reward from multiple options; the reward options depend on the total purchase value. Finally, the items are delivered.  A LOOP construct governs returns: the DO part is the item delivery, and the REDO part consists of the return process followed by a new item delivery.

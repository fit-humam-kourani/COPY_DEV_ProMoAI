This process initiates with the identification of an employee's development needs and career aspirations.  This is followed by the creation of a personal development plan by the manager and HR, potentially encompassing training programs, mentorship opportunities, or the assignment of additional responsibilities.  The employee concurrently engages in skill enhancement activities while receiving ongoing feedback and performance evaluations from supervisors.  The achievement of predefined milestones triggers consideration for promotion or a new role.  A formal performance review is then conducted by HR.  There is an XOR choice between approving the promotion or rejecting it. If approved, the promotion is finalized, involving the assignment of new responsibilities and corresponding compensation adjustments. The process concludes upon the employee's successful promotion and transition to the new role.

The Evanstonian's room service process begins when a guest places an order with the room-service manager.  The manager creates an order ticket and submits it to the kitchen for food preparation. Concurrently, the manager sends an order to the sommelier to retrieve wine and prepare alcoholic beverages.  This constitutes a partial order, as the kitchen and sommelier tasks proceed independently.  There is an XOR choice between the sommelier processing an alcoholic beverage order or skipping this step (representing the 20% of orders without alcoholic beverages).  Concurrently with the kitchen and sommelier processes, the waiter prepares a room service cart. The waiter is also responsible for preparing non-alcoholic beverages.  Once the food preparation (from the kitchen), alcoholic beverage preparation (from the sommelier, if applicable), and cart preparation are complete, a partial order is established where the waiter delivers the order to the guest's room. After the delivery, the waiter debits the guest's account.  A loop exists where if the waiter has another order, they proceed to prepare/deliver; otherwise the loop terminates.

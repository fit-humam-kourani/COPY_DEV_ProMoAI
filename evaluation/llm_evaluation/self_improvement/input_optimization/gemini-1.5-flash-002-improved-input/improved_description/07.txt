This process initiates upon a customer search for a flight, train, or bus ticket.  The customer then selects a preferred route, date, and time. Subsequently, the customer provides personal information and payment details.  This is followed by the booking system generating a ticket, which is then sent to the customer via email or SMS. Concurrently, the travel company updates its seat inventory.  Optionally, the customer may receive pre-travel reminders and check-in/boarding instructions. This optional step occurs before the customer completes their journey, marking the process's conclusion.  Post-travel feedback or services may be offered, constituting an extension of the main process.

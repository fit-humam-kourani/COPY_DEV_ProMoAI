This process begins with continuous monitoring of inventory levels in a warehouse or store.  A threshold check compares current inventory levels against predefined minimum stock levels. This check triggers an alert, either automatically or manually initiated.  The alert signals the need to reorder.  This initiates a procurement process. The procurement team then places an order with a supplier selected based on criteria including cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability.  Supplier selection may involve evaluating multiple potential suppliers; this selection process could involve an XOR construct to model the exclusive selection of a single supplier. After order placement, the inventory management system is updated to reflect the expected delivery date. Upon arrival of the shipment, a quality inspection is performed.  Successful inspection results in recording the received stock in the inventory system and placing the stock in its designated storage location. Failure of the quality inspection may trigger a return to the supplier (modeled using a LOOP construct).  The process concludes with the final update of inventory levels reflecting the completed restock.  The entire process can be modeled using a partial order to show concurrency, where appropriate, between activities such as order placement and system updates.

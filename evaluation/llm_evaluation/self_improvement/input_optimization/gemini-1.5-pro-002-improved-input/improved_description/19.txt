The process for purchasing items from an online shop begins with the user logging in to their account.  Subsequently, the selection of items to purchase and the setting of a payment method occur concurrently.  Following this, there is an exclusive choice: the user either pays or completes an installment agreement.  Concurrently with the payment activities, and subsequent to the selection of items, the user chooses a free reward from multiple available options.  After both the payment/installment agreement and the reward selection are completed, the items are delivered.  Finally, there is a loop construct: the “do” part consists of the delivery of items. The “redo” part consists of the user returning items for exchange.

This process begins when a customer signs up for a subscription service.  The customer enters their personal and payment information. The system then generates a new account, assigns the appropriate access privileges to the customer, and initiates automated billing cycles.  Following account creation, the customer regularly receives updates, which can include product enhancements, or renewal notifications. The subscription period continues until the customer decides to cancel the service.  To cancel, the customer submits a cancellation request.  Upon receiving the cancellation request, the support team processes the request. The support team assesses applicable terms and conditions and applies any necessary refunds or charges based on these terms.  Finally, the support team deactivates the subscription and settles the final account balance. This marks the conclusion of the process.

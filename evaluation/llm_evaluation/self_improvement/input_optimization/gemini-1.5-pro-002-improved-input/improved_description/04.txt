The process begins with defining the objectives of a marketing campaign. This involves specifying the target audience and setting measurable goals, such as generating a specific number of leads or achieving a certain percentage increase in brand awareness. Following this, the marketing team embarks on content creation, visual design, and channel selection.  The channel selection involves a choice between various options, including digital ads, email marketing, social media posts, or a combination thereof.  After the content and visuals are finalized, and the channels are selected, the campaign is launched.  Once launched, real-time performance tracking is initiated, utilizing metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement metrics. Concurrently with campaign execution, leads generated from the campaign are collected and integrated into the CRM system. This allows sales teams to access and follow up on these leads. The campaign continues until the predefined campaign period ends. Once the campaign period ends, the entire process concludes with a performance analysis. This analysis serves the purpose of optimizing future marketing campaigns.  The analysis may lead to adjustments in objectives, target audience, content, visuals, channel selection, or other aspects of the process for subsequent campaigns.

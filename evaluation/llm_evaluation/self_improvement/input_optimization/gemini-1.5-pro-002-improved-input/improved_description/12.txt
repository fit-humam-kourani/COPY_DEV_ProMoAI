This process begins with identifying an employeeâ€™s development needs or career aspirations.  The manager and HR then collaborate to create a personal development plan. This plan may include training programs, mentorship, or the assignment of additional responsibilities.  The plan must define specific milestones that will be used to assess progress. The employee then works on enhancing their skills based on the agreed-upon development plan. Concurrently, the employee receives regular feedback and evaluations from their supervisors related to their progress. This cycle of skill enhancement, feedback, and evaluation continues until the defined milestones are reached.  Once the milestones are reached, the employee becomes eligible for consideration for a promotion or a new role.  At this point, HR conducts a formal review of the employee's performance against the established milestones.  There is an exclusive choice: either the employee's performance is deemed satisfactory or it is not. If the performance review is successful, the promotion is finalized, which involves defining new responsibilities and making necessary compensation adjustments. If the review is not successful, the employee continues the cycle of skill development, feedback, and evaluation, working towards achieving the milestones. The process ends when the employee is promoted and successfully transitions into the new role.

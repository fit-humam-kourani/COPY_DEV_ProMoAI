An e-commerce company's order fulfillment process begins when a customer places an order, at which point the system records the order details. Subsequently, payment processing begins.  There is an exclusive choice between payment success and payment failure. If the payment fails, the customer is notified, and the process ends. If the payment is successful, the inventory system checks stock availability.  Following the stock availability check, there is an exclusive choice: either all items are in stock, or some items are out of stock. If items are out of stock, a back-order is initiated, and the customer is informed about the delay.  The process continues once the back-order is received and all required items are available in stock.  If all items are in stock, the in-stock items are picked from the warehouse.  Following picking, quality control checks are performed on the picked items.  After quality control, packaging is done, including an exclusive choice between gift-wrapping (if requested by the customer) and no gift-wrapping. Concurrently with picking and subsequent steps, the shipping department prepares shipping documents and labels.  If the order is international, customs documentation is prepared, otherwise, this step is skipped. Once both packaging is complete and shipping documents are ready, the order is dispatched. Upon dispatch, the system sends a shipping confirmation to the customer. After dispatch, the system updates the inventory levels. A follow-up email for feedback is sent to the customer after successful delivery is confirmed.  After sending the follow-up email, there is an exclusive choice: the customer either reports an issue or does not report an issue. If the customer reports any issues upon delivery, a returns process is initiated. The returns process includes the following steps executed in sequence: sending a return shipping label, receiving returned items, inspecting returned items, and finally processing a refund or replacement. If the customer does not report an issue, the process ends.

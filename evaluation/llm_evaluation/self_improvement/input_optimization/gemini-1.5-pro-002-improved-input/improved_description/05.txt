The process begins when a company identifies the need for a new supplier or vendor. The procurement team then issues a request for proposals (RFP). Following the RFP release, the process proceeds with receiving responses from various suppliers.  Each received proposal is then evaluated based on pre-defined criteria, including cost, quality, and delivery time.  In parallel to proposal evaluation, the procurement team may optionally conduct site visits and/or interviews with suppliers. After the proposal evaluation is complete, and any optional site visits and/or interviews are concluded, a supplier is selected. Subsequently, contract negotiations begin with the selected supplier. The contract negotiation process involves iterative discussions and revisions until both parties reach an agreement on all terms.  Once an agreement is reached, the contract is signed by both parties.  Finally, the process ends when the selected supplier is officially onboarded and the signed contract is fully executed.

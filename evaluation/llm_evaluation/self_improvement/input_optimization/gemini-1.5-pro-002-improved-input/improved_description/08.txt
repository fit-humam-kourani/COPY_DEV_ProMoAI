This process begins when either an employee or a customer reports an incident, such as a technical issue or a workplace safety concern.  The report is logged into a tracking system, and subsequently, the incident report is assigned to the appropriate team based on the nature of the incident.  The assigned team then gathers all necessary information related to the reported incident, including but not limited to interviews, system logs, and physical evidence. Following the information gathering, the team analyzes the collected information to identify the root cause of the incident.  Based on the identified root cause, the team proposes and documents one or more corrective actions to address the incident.  The chosen corrective action, which could be a system fix, additional employee training, or a policy change, is then implemented. After the implementation of the corrective action, a follow-up assessment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the implemented solution and ensure that the incident will not recur. This follow-up may involve further data collection and analysis. Once the follow-up assessment confirms the issue is resolved, the incident report is formally closed in the tracking system. Finally, all involved stakeholders, including the individual who reported the incident, are notified of the closure and resolution of the incident.

This process begins when a potential customer inquires about a product or service.  Sales staff or customer support gathers relevant information from the customer, such as their needs, budget, and technical requirements.  They then address any customer concerns or questions regarding the product or service, including pricing, features, and availability.  If the customer expresses further interest, they are guided through the selection of the appropriate product or service based on their previously gathered information.  This selection process may involve presenting different options, comparing features, and offering expert advice. Following the selection, the sales representative prepares and provides a detailed quote to the customer.  The customer then reviews the quote, which may involve negotiation and clarification.  After explicit approval of the quote from the customer, the process proceeds to order placement.  Order placement involves recording the order details, including the chosen product or service, quantity, pricing, and customer information, into the system.  Following successful order entry, the customer receives a confirmation of their order, including details such as order number, expected delivery date, and payment information. The process ends when both the order has been successfully recorded in the system and the customer has received and acknowledged the order confirmation.

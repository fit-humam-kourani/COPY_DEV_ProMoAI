The process begins with the scheduling of a compliance audit by the company for a specific set of regulations (e.g., ISO standards, safety protocols, or environmental guidelines).  Following the scheduling, internal teams perform three parallel activities: preparing the necessary documentation, gathering evidence to support compliance, and conducting a self-assessment to identify potential gaps.  These three parallel activities must all be completed before the external audit can commence.  The external audit involves a review of the company's processes by external auditors, who identify any gaps or issues in compliance. If gaps or issues are identified, the company is required to make the necessary corrections or improvements.  After the corrections or improvements are made, the company undergoes a final audit by the external auditors.  Following the final audit, there is an exclusive choice: either the company meets all criteria and proceeds to certification, or the company does not meet all criteria and the process concludes without certification.  If the company is awarded certification, the process concludes with the issuance of official certification documents.

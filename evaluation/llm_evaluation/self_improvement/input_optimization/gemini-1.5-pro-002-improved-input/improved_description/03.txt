This process begins with continuous monitoring of inventory levels for each product in a warehouse or store.  If the stock level of any product reaches a predefined minimum threshold, an automated alert is generated.  There is an exclusive choice between receiving an automated alert or performing a manual check to identify the need to reorder. If a manual check is chosen, this check is performed periodically.  When the need to reorder is signaled (either by an automated alert or a manual check), the procurement team reviews the current stock levels of the product and initiates the reordering process.  The procurement team selects a supplier for the product, considering factors like cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability. There is an exclusive choice between using a preferred supplier or selecting a new supplier based on these factors.  Once a supplier is selected, the procurement team places an order with the chosen supplier, specifying the quantity of the product to be ordered. The order details are then recorded, and the inventory system is updated with the expected delivery date for the order.  Upon receiving the ordered stock, the received stock is inspected for quality.  There is an exclusive choice between accepting or rejecting the received stock based on the quality inspection.  If the stock is accepted, it is recorded in the inventory system and then placed on shelves or in storage.  After the accepted stock is stored, the inventory levels in the system are updated to reflect the new stock quantity.  The process ends when the inventory levels for the product are updated in the system after the restocking is complete. If the stock is rejected, the supplier is contacted and the rejection is recorded in the system.  Then there is an exclusive choice between re-ordering the rejected product or canceling the order entirely. If reordering is chosen, the process of selecting a supplier and placing a new order is repeated. If canceling the order is chosen, the inventory levels are checked and the cycle begins again, starting with the monitoring of inventory levels.

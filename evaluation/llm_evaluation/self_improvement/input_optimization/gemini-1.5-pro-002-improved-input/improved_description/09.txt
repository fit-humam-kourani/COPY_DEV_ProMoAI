The process begins with identifying an idea for a new product or improvement to an existing one.  The R&D team then conducts initial research and feasibility studies to determine the viability of the idea.  Following the feasibility studies, the R&D team drafts multiple design concepts.  A promising design is selected from the available concepts.  This selection leads to the prototype building phase, utilizing available materials and resources.  The constructed prototype then undergoes a testing phase, encompassing functionality tests, safety tests, and market potential assessments.  Feedback is collected from each of the tests.  There is an exclusive choice between needing a refinement based on the feedback and proceeding directly to the final decision.  If a refinement is needed, the prototype is refined accordingly, and the testing phase (including functionality tests, safety tests, and market potential assessments, followed by feedback collection) is repeated. This loop of refinement and testing continues until no further refinement is needed. Finally, there is an exclusive choice: either the prototype is approved for further development or the prototype is discarded.  At this point, the process ends.

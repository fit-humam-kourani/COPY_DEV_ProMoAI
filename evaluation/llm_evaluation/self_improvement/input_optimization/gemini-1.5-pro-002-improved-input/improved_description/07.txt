This process begins when a customer searches for a flight, train, or bus ticket. The customer selects the preferred route, date, and time from the available options. Following selection, the customer provides personal information, including name and contact details, and payment details, such as credit card information or other payment methods.  The booking system then verifies the payment and generates a ticket.  The generated ticket is sent to the customer via email or SMS. Concurrently, the travel company updates its seat inventory to reflect the booking.  Before the date of travel, the customer may receive reminders about the upcoming trip and instructions for check-in or boarding procedures, depending on the mode of transport.  The core process concludes once the customer completes their journey.  A partially ordered subsequent process may involve post-travel feedback requests, loyalty program updates, or other related services. This subsequent process is optional and does not affect the completion of the core travel booking process.

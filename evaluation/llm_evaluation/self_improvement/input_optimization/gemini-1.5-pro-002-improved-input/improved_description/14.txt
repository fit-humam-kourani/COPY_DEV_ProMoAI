This process begins with a department outlining its objectives for the upcoming period, such as hiring, equipment needs, or marketing efforts. The team then drafts a plan, including detailed cost estimates and justifications for each budget item requested. This draft plan is then reviewed in a strategic alignment meeting to ensure it aligns with broader organizational goals.  The outcome of this meeting is either approval to proceed or a request for revisions to better align the plan. Following strategic alignment, the finance department performs a detailed review to assess the budget's feasibility. This review considers factors such as available funds, projected revenue, and potential return on investment. Based on the finance departmentâ€™s review, the plan may undergo adjustments.  The process iteratively loops through the steps of plan adjustment, documentation of the adjustments, stakeholder approval of the adjustments, and subsequent review by the finance department until the finance department approves the adjusted plan.  Once the final version of the budget is approved by the finance department, the budget is officially allocated to the department.  Finally, the budget is distributed to the department, and the department begins implementing its plan, marking the end of the budget allocation process.

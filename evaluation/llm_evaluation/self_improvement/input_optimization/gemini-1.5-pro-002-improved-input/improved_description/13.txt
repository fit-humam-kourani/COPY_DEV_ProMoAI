The process begins when a customer files a complaint about a product or service. Customer service logs the complaint and assigns it to the relevant department for investigation. The assigned team reviews the complaint details.  Following the review, the team makes a decision regarding the complaint's validity and whether a refund is justified.  The customer is then notified of the decision.  There is an exclusive choice: if the refund is approved, the financial team processes the reimbursement. The complaint is marked as resolved either after the customer receives the refund or immediately after the customer is notified of the rejected refund. After the complaint is marked as resolved, there is a choice for the customer to provide feedback on their satisfaction.

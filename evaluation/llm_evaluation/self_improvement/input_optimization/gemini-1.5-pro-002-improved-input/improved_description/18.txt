A university enrollment system involves the following steps:

1.  A prospective student submits an application online.
2.  The admissions office reviews the application and supporting documents.
3.  LOOP:
    *   DO: Check for missing documents.
    *   REDO: If documents are missing, the applicant is notified to provide the missing items.  This loop continues until all documents are received.
4.  Upon receiving all documents, the application is evaluated by the admissions committee.
5.  Concurrently with the evaluation by the admissions committee, the finance department processes any application fees or waivers.
6.  XOR: The application is either accepted or rejected.
    *   If the application is accepted, an acceptance letter is sent.
    *   If the application is rejected, a rejection letter is sent, and the process ends.
7.  If accepted, the student must confirm enrollment by a specified deadline. If the student does not confirm by the deadline, the application is canceled and the process ends.
8.  If the student confirms enrollment, the student receives orientation materials. Concurrently, the IT department sets up student accounts for email, online portals, and library access.
9.  If the student is international, the international student office assists with visa processing. This occurs concurrently with receiving orientation materials and IT account setup if the student confirms their enrollment.
10. The student obtains a student ID card.
11. The student creates their study plan, which consists of the following ordered steps:
    *   Meeting with an academic advisor.
    *   Selecting courses.
    *   Resolving any schedule conflicts.
12. The student begins attending classes.
13. LOOP: For each semester until the student graduates or withdraws, the following steps are repeated:
    *   DO: The student attends classes.  Within the add/drop period of each semester, the student may add or drop courses. At the end of each semester, grades are posted, and the student can review them online.
    *   REDO: XOR: The student decides to continue studying or to withdraw.  If the student chooses to withdraw, the process ends.
14. XOR: At any point during the semester, the student may or may not have grievances.
    *   If the student has grievances, they can file an appeal. The appeal process consists of the following ordered steps:
        *   Submitting an appeal form.
        *   Meeting with the appeals committee.
        *   Awaiting a decision.
        *   This entire appeal process can occur during a semester, concurrently with other semester activities.
    *    If the student has no grievances, they simply continue with the semester.

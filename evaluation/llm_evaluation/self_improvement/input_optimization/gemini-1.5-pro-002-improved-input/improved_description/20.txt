The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service, the room-service manager takes down the order.  She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin food preparation. Concurrently, she gives an order to the sommelier to fetch wine from the cellar and prepare any other alcoholic beverages. This sommelier task is performed as part of an exclusive choice; in approximately 80% of cases, the order includes alcoholic beverages, and in the remaining cases, this task is skipped.  Concurrently with the kitchen and sommelier tasks, the waiter readies a cart, which involves putting a tablecloth on the cart and gathering silverware. The waiter is also responsible for obtaining any non-alcoholic drinks.  Once the food preparation is complete, the sommelier's tasks (if any) are finished, and the cart is ready, the waiter places the food, alcoholic beverages (if any), and non-alcoholic beverages on the cart and delivers it to the guest's room. Upon returning to the room-service station, there is an exclusive choice: either the waiter debits the guest's account immediately, or, if the waiter has another order to prepare or deliver, the billing is postponed and performed after the other order is handled. This postponed billing task is then followed by returning to the point where another exclusive choice is presented for any subsequent orders.

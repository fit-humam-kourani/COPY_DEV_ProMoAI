The audit process begins when the audit coordinator sends a notification to the regional office, initiating the audit process. Following the notification, the regional office prepares the financial statements and gathers the necessary documents. Concurrently with the document preparation, the compliance team checks for any regulatory updates that might impact the audit.  Once the documents are prepared, the regional office submits them to the central audit team. The central audit team then reviews the submitted documents.  If any discrepancies are found during the review, the central audit team requests clarifications from the regional office, and the regional office provides the requested clarifications. This clarification process loops until the central audit team finds no further discrepancies. When the review is complete and no discrepancies remain, the audit team performs a risk assessment. The risk assessment consists of three parts: evaluating financial risks, operational risks, and compliance risks. These three evaluations can be performed in any order, but all must be completed before the risk assessment is considered finished. If the risk assessment identifies any high risks, a detailed investigation is launched. This investigation may include data analysis, interviews, and site visits.  The site visit is an optional part of the investigation and may not always be required.  After all identified risks are addressed, the audit team compiles the audit report.  Following compilation, the audit director reviews the report.  The audit director then makes an exclusive choice: either approve the report or request revisions.  If revisions are requested, the audit team updates the report based on the feedback and resubmits the revised report to the audit director for review.  This review and revision process loops until the audit director approves the report. Upon approval by the audit director, the final report is distributed to the executive board and archived. After distribution and archival, the entire audit process is closed.

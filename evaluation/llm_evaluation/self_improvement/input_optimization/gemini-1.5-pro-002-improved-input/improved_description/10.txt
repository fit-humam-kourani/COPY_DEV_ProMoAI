The process begins with the submission of a request for an IT solution (e.g., new software or hardware) by either an employee or a department.  Following the request submission, the IT department assesses the request. This assessment involves two parallel activities: a compatibility check with existing systems and an evaluation of cost and resource needs.  After both the compatibility check and resource evaluation are complete, a decision is made whether to approve or reject the request. If the request is approved, the IT department procures the necessary tools or licenses.  Subsequently, the IT department installs the solution.  Following installation, the solution undergoes testing in a controlled environment. If the testing is successful, the new solution is rolled out to the requesting department.  After rollout, there is an exclusive choice between providing training and not providing training.  Regardless of whether training is provided, ongoing IT support remains available for troubleshooting.

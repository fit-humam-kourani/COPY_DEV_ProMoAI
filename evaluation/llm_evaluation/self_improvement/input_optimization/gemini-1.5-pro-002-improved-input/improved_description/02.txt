This process begins when a department identifies the need for a new hire.  HR creates a job description.  The job description is then posted on job boards.  Resumes are collected.  The collected resumes are screened. Initial phone interviews are conducted with a subset of the applicants.  Following the initial phone interviews, a selection of candidates are made.  For each selected candidate, an exclusive choice is made between an in-person interview and a virtual interview based on the candidate's preference.  A candidate is then chosen from those interviewed. An offer is extended to the chosen candidate.  Following the offer, there is an exclusive choice between conducting salary negotiations or skipping salary negotiations. If salary negotiations take place and an agreement is not reached, the process loops back to extending an offer to a different candidate. If salary negotiations are skipped or successfully concluded, the offer is either accepted or rejected by the candidate.  If the offer is rejected, the process loops back to extending an offer to a different candidate. If the offer is accepted, the onboarding process begins. The onboarding process consists of completing paperwork, attending orientation, and undertaking training, which can occur concurrently.  The process concludes once all onboarding steps: paperwork, orientation, and training, are completed and the new hire is fully integrated into the team.

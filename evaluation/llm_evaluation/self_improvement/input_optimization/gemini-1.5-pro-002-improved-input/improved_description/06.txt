This process begins when a customer places an order, which can be done either through an online platform or over the phone.  Upon order placement, the system automatically generates an order confirmation and sends it to the customer. Following this, the warehouse team picks the ordered items and packs them.  A shipping label is then generated. Subsequently, the packaged order with the shipping label is handed over to a logistics provider for delivery.  After the handover, tracking information is sent to the customer. The process then enters a monitoring phase where the shipment's progress is tracked until it reaches the customer's designated delivery address.  Upon successful delivery confirmation, the main order fulfillment process ends.  However, following the successful delivery, there is a possibility of two separate, independent subsequent processes: the customer may provide feedback and/or the customer may initiate a return. These subsequent processes are optional and do not affect the completion status of the main order fulfillment process.

The process begins when a customer submits personal and payment information as part of signing up for a subscription service.  Upon receiving the information, the system generates a new customer account, assigns the appropriate access privileges to the customer, and initiates automated recurring billing cycles based on the chosen subscription. Following successful account creation, the customer regularly receives updates, which can include product enhancements or renewal notifications.  If the customer chooses to cancel the subscription, they submit a cancellation request.  This request is then processed by the support team.  The support team assesses the cancellation request against the subscription terms and conditions, and depending on these terms, any applicable refunds or charges are calculated and applied to the customer's account. Finally, the support team deactivates the customer's subscription, settles the final account balance (applying any calculated refunds or charges), concluding the process.

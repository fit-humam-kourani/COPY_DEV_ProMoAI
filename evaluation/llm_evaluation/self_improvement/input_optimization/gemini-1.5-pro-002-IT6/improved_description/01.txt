This process begins when a potential customer initiates an inquiry regarding a product or service.  Sales staff or customer support personnel gather relevant information from the customer, including their needs and requirements, and address any customer concerns or questions regarding the product or service.  If the customer expresses further interest, they are guided by the sales staff (or customer support) through the selection of the appropriate product or service based on their previously gathered information. Following product/service selection, the sales representative generates and presents a quote to the customer.  If the customer approves the provided quote, the process proceeds to order placement.  The order details, including product/service specifications and customer information, are then recorded in the order management system.  Upon successful order recording, the customer receives confirmation of their order, including order details and expected delivery/fulfillment timeframe.  The process concludes when the order has been successfully placed in the system and the order confirmation has been sent to the customer.

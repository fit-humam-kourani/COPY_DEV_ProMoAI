The process begins when a customer initiates a search for a travel ticket, specifying the desired mode of transportation (flight, train, or bus).  Following the search, the customer selects a preferred route, travel date, and time from the available options.  Subsequently, the customer is required to provide personal information and payment details to proceed with the booking. Upon successful payment verification, the booking system generates a travel ticket. This ticket is then transmitted to the customer electronically, either via email or SMS. Concurrently, the travel company's seat inventory system is updated to reflect the confirmed booking.  In the period leading up to the travel date, the customer may receive pre-travel reminders and specific instructions regarding check-in or boarding procedures, depending on the chosen mode of transport. The core travel booking process concludes once the customer completes their journey. However, the overall process may extend slightly further if post-travel feedback is provided or post-travel services are utilized.

The process begins when a company initiates a compliance audit scheduling activity for a specific set of regulations (e.g., ISO standards, safety protocols, or environmental guidelines). Following the scheduling, internal teams perform three parallel activities: documentation preparation, evidence gathering, and self-assessment. These activities are carried out in preparation for an external audit.  Next, external auditors review the company's processes, resulting in an identification of gaps and issues.  Based on the identified gaps and issues, the company undertakes corrective actions and improvements.  Subsequently, a final audit is conducted by the external auditors.  If the results of the final audit meet all pre-defined criteria, the company is awarded certification.  The final step in the process, conditional upon successful certification, is the issuance of official certification documents.  Upon completion of document issuance, the process concludes.

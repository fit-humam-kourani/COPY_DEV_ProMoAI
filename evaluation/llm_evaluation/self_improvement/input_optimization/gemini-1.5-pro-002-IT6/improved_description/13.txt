The process starts when a customer submits a complaint regarding a product or service.  Customer service logs the complaint, capturing all relevant details such as customer information, product/service information, and complaint description.  The complaint is then assigned to the appropriate department based on the nature of the complaint. The assigned department reviews the complaint details to determine its validity. Following the review, a decision is made regarding whether a refund is justified. The customer is then notified of the decision, including the justification for approval or rejection of the refund.  If the refund is approved, the complaint information is forwarded to the financial team. The financial team then processes the reimbursement to the customer.  The complaint is marked as resolved after the customer receives the refund. If the refund was rejected, the complaint is marked as resolved immediately after the customer has been notified of the decision.  Following the resolution of the complaint, the customer has the opportunity to provide feedback regarding their satisfaction with the complaint handling process.

This process begins when a department outlines its objectives for the upcoming period, such as hiring, equipment needs, or marketing efforts. The department team then drafts a plan that includes specific cost estimates for each objective and justifications for the total budget requested. This drafted plan is then submitted for review.  The first review occurs in a strategic alignment meeting where the plan is evaluated to ensure it aligns with the broader organizational goals. If the plan is not strategically aligned, it is revised by the department team and resubmitted for strategic alignment review.  Following successful strategic alignment review, the finance department performs a detailed review of the plan to assess the budget's feasibility.  This detailed review may result in feedback requiring adjustments to the plan. If adjustments are required, the department team revises the plan, documents the specific adjustments made, and obtains approval for these adjustments from the necessary stakeholders. The revised plan is then resubmitted to the finance department for review. These review and revision cycles continue until the finance department approves the plan. Once the final version of the budget is approved by the finance department, the budget is officially allocated to the department.  Finally, the budget is distributed to the department, and the department begins implementing its plan, marking the end of the process.

This process begins when a department identifies the need for a new hire and submits a hiring request to HR.  Upon receiving the hiring request, HR creates a job description and posts it on relevant job boards.  Applications, including resumes, are collected.  HR then screens the received applications based on pre-defined criteria.  Candidates who meet the initial screening criteria undergo a phone interview. Based on the phone interview performance, selected candidates are invited for a secondary interview, which can be either in-person or virtual, based on the candidate's preference and feasibility.  If a candidate is deemed suitable after the secondary interview, HR extends a job offer.  Following the offer extension, there may be a negotiation process regarding salary and benefits.  If the candidate accepts the offer, the onboarding process is initiated. The onboarding process consists of completing necessary paperwork, attending an orientation session, and undergoing specific job training. The process concludes when all onboarding steps are completed, and the new hire is fully integrated into the team and their assigned department.

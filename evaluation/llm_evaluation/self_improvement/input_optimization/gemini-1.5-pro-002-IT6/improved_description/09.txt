The process begins with the identification of an idea for a new product or an improvement to an existing product. Following the idea identification, the R&D team conducts initial research and feasibility studies.  Based on the research and feasibility studies, the R&D team drafts design concepts. Subsequently, a promising design is selected from the drafted concepts. After the design selection, a prototype is built utilizing available materials and resources.  The constructed prototype then undergoes various tests to assess its functionality, safety, and market potential.  The results of these tests generate feedback. Based on the feedback received, there is an exclusive choice between refining the prototype or proceeding without refinement. If the prototype is refined, the testing phase is repeated. This cycle of testing and potential refinement continues until a decision is made.  The process concludes with either the approval of the prototype for further development or its discard.

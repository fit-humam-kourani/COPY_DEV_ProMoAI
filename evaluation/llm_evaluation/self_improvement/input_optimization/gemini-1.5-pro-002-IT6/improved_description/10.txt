The process begins with the submission of a request for an IT solution (e.g., new software or hardware) by either an employee or a department.  Following the request submission, the IT department assesses the request. This assessment involves a compatibility check with existing systems and an evaluation of the associated costs and resource requirements.  An exclusive choice is then made to either approve or reject the request based on the assessment. If the request is approved, the IT department proceeds with procurement of the necessary tools or licenses.  Subsequent to procurement, the IT department installs the solution and performs testing within a controlled environment.  Following successful testing, the new solution is rolled out to the requesting department.  After rollout, there is an exclusive choice between providing training and not providing training. Regardless of whether training is provided, ongoing IT support remains available for troubleshooting purposes.

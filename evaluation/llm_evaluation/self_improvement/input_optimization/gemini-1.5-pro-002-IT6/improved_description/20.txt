The process begins when a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian hotel.  The room-service manager receives the call and records the order details. Following this, the room-service manager creates and submits an order ticket to the kitchen to initiate food preparation.  Concurrently, the room-service manager checks if the order includes alcoholic beverages. If the order includes alcoholic beverages (which occurs in 80% of cases), the room-service manager gives a separate order to the sommelier to retrieve the requested wine from the cellar and prepare any other specified alcoholic drinks.  If the order does not include alcoholic beverages, this step is skipped.  The room-service manager then assigns the order to a waiter.  After being assigned the order, the waiter prepares a cart by placing a tablecloth and gathering the necessary silverware.  The waiter also gathers any non-alcoholic beverages included in the order.  The waiter then waits for the food preparation to be completed by the kitchen and, if applicable, for the alcoholic beverages to be prepared by the sommelier.  Once both the food and any requested alcoholic beverages are ready and the waiter has completed the cart setup, the waiter collects the prepared items and delivers them to the guest's room. Upon returning to the room-service station, the waiter initiates the billing process by debiting the guest's account.  However, if the waiter has another order to prepare or deliver, the billing process may be postponed until those tasks are completed.

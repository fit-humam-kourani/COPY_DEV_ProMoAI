The process begins when a customer places an order, at which point the system records the order details. Subsequently, payment processing is initiated. There is an exclusive choice based on the payment outcome: if the payment fails, the customer is notified, and the process ends. If the payment is successful, the inventory system checks stock availability for each item in the order.  If any item is out of stock, a back-order is initiated for that item, and the customer is informed about the potential shipping delay. The process pauses at this point and resumes once the back-ordered item is received and all items in the order are available in stock.  For items in stock, they are picked from the warehouse. Following picking, quality control checks are performed on the picked items. Subsequently, the items are packaged.  If the customer requested gift wrapping at the time of order placement, gift wrapping is included in the packaging process. Concurrently with the picking, quality control, and packaging steps, the shipping department prepares shipping documents and labels. If the order is marked as international at the time of order placement, customs documentation is prepared in addition to the standard shipping documents. Once both the packaging process and the preparation of all required shipping documents (including any customs documentation) are complete, the order is dispatched.  Upon dispatch, the system sends a shipping confirmation to the customer. After dispatch, the system updates the inventory levels to reflect the shipped items. After the customer receives the order, a follow-up email requesting feedback is sent to the customer. If the customer reports any issues with the delivered order, a returns process is initiated. The returns process consists of sending a return shipping label to the customer, receiving the returned items, inspecting the returned items, and finally, processing either a refund or a replacement based on the inspection outcome.

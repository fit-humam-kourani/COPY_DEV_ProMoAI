This process begins when a customer places an order either through an online platform or by phone.  Upon order placement, the system automatically generates an order confirmation and sends it to the customer via email (for online orders) or through an SMS message (for phone orders).  The warehouse team then receives the order details and proceeds to pick the ordered items from inventory.  Following item picking, the items are packed securely for shipment, and a shipping label is generated containing the customer's address and tracking information.  The packaged order, along with the generated shipping label, is then handed over to a designated logistics provider for delivery.  After the handover, tracking information is sent to the customer, allowing them to monitor the shipment's progress.  The process continues with the system monitoring the shipment status through updates from the logistics provider until the order is marked as delivered to the customerâ€™s specified address.  Upon successful delivery confirmation, the main order fulfillment process ends. However, subsequent customer feedback (e.g., satisfaction surveys, complaints) or the initiation of a product return by the customer may trigger additional processes.

The university enrollment process begins when a prospective student submits an application online.  The admissions office then reviews the submitted application and supporting documents.  If any supporting documents are missing, the admissions office notifies the applicant to provide them. This notification and document submission process repeats until all required documents are received.  Once all documents are received, the admissions committee evaluates the application. Concurrently, the finance department processes any associated application fees or waivers.  There is an exclusive choice; either the application is accepted or rejected. If the application is accepted, the admissions office sends an acceptance letter to the applicant. If the application is rejected, the admissions office sends a rejection letter to the applicant, and the process ends.  Following acceptance, the student must confirm their enrollment by a specified deadline.  If the student does not confirm enrollment by the deadline, the application is canceled, and the process ends. If the student confirms enrollment, they receive orientation materials, and the IT department sets up the student's accounts for email, online portals, and library access.  Additionally, if the student is international, the international student office assists with visa processing.  The student then obtains a student ID card and begins creating their study plan. This study plan creation involves meeting with an academic advisor, selecting courses, and resolving any schedule conflicts.  Subsequently, the student begins attending classes.  Throughout each semester, there is an option for the student to add or drop courses within the designated add/drop period.  At the end of each semester, the university posts the student's grades, which the student can review online. If the student has any grievances regarding their grades, they can file an appeal. The appeal process involves submitting an appeal form, meeting with the appeals committee, and awaiting a decision. This entire process, from the beginning of a semester to the end, repeats for each semester until the student either graduates or withdraws from the university.

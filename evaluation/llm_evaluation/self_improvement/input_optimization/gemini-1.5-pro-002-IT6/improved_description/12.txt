This process begins with the identification of an employeeâ€™s development needs and career aspirations. Following this identification, the employee's manager and a Human Resources (HR) representative collaborate to create a personalized development plan. This plan may include recommendations for training programs, mentorship opportunities, or the assignment of additional responsibilities.  The employee then works on enhancing their skills based on the agreed-upon development plan.  During this skill enhancement period, the employee receives ongoing feedback and periodic evaluations from their supervisor(s). When pre-defined milestones within the development plan are reached, the employee becomes eligible for consideration for a promotion or a new role.  At this point, HR conducts a formal review of the employee's performance.  If the review is positive and the promotion or new role is approved, the promotion is finalized.  This finalization includes defining the employee's new responsibilities and making necessary compensation adjustments. The process concludes with the employee's successful transition into the promoted or new role.

The process begins with the definition of marketing campaign objectives. This definition includes specifying the target audience and setting goals, such as lead generation or brand awareness increase.  Following objective definition, the marketing team creates campaign content, designs visuals, and selects promotional channels. These channels may include digital advertisements, email marketing, or social media posts. After content creation, design, and channel selection, the campaign is launched.  Upon launch, campaign performance is monitored in real-time using metrics such as click-through rates and conversions.  Concurrently with campaign execution, leads generated by the campaign are collected within the CRM system.  This allows sales teams to follow up on these leads.  The campaign continues until the pre-defined campaign period ends.  At the end of the campaign period, the overall performance is analyzed to optimize future campaigns. This analysis marks the conclusion of the process.

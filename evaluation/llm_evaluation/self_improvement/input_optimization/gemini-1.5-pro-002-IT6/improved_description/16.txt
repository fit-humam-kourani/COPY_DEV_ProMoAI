The audit process in a multinational company begins when the audit coordinator sends a notification to the regional office, initiating the audit.  Upon receiving the notification, the regional office prepares the financial statements and gathers the necessary supporting documents. Concurrently, the compliance team checks for any updates to regulations that may impact the current audit.  Following the document preparation and regulatory review, the regional office submits all gathered documents and information to the central audit team. The central audit team then reviews the submitted documents.  If any discrepancies are identified during the review, the central audit team requests clarification from the regional office. The regional office then provides the requested clarifications. This clarification process iterates until the central audit team is satisfied with the submitted documentation. Once the review is complete and no further discrepancies exist, the audit team performs a risk assessment. This risk assessment involves evaluating financial risks, operational risks, and compliance risks.  These three risk evaluations can occur in any order, but all three must be completed before the risk assessment is considered finished. If a high-risk area is identified in any of the three risk evaluations, a detailed investigation is launched. This detailed investigation may include data analysis, interviews, and site visits (the occurrence of site visits being conditional). Once all identified risks are addressed, the audit team compiles a comprehensive audit report.  The compiled audit report is then submitted to the audit director for review. The audit director reviews the report and makes a decision to either approve the report or request revisions.  If revisions are requested, the audit team revises the report accordingly and resubmits the updated version to the audit director for another review.  This review and revision process iterates until the audit director approves the report. Upon final approval by the audit director, the report is distributed to the executive board and archived. Following the distribution and archival of the report, the entire audit process is formally closed.

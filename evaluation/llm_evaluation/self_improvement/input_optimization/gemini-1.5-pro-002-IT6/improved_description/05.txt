The process begins when a company identifies the need for a new supplier or vendor.  The procurement team then initiates the process by issuing a request for proposals (RFP), detailing the specific requirements and criteria.  Following the RFP release, the team receives responses from various potential suppliers.  Each received proposal undergoes an evaluation process based on pre-defined criteria such as cost, quality of goods/services, and estimated delivery time.  This evaluation may include additional steps like conducting site visits to assess supplier facilities and capabilities or holding interviews with supplier representatives to gather further information.  After the evaluation of all received proposals is completed, the procurement team selects the most suitable supplier based on the defined criteria and evaluation results.  Subsequently, contract negotiations begin with the selected supplier. This negotiation process involves discussions and revisions of terms and conditions until both parties reach a mutual agreement.  Once an agreement is reached, the contract is formally signed by both the company and the selected supplier.  Finally, the process concludes with the official onboarding of the new supplier, marking the commencement of the contract execution.

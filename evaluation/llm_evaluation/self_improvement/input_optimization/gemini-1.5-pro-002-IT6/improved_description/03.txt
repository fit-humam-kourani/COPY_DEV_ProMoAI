This process begins with continuous monitoring of inventory levels of all items in a warehouse or store.  When the stock level of an item reaches a predefined minimum threshold, either an automated system generates an alert or a manual check triggers a reorder signal.  Following the reorder signal, the procurement team initiates the ordering process. This involves evaluating potential suppliers based on factors like cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability, and subsequently selecting a supplier and placing an order for the required quantity of the item. After the order is placed, the inventory management system is updated to reflect the order and the expected delivery date. Upon the physical arrival of the ordered stock, a quality inspection is performed.  If the stock passes the inspection, it is officially recorded into the inventory management system and subsequently placed on shelves in the sales area or stored in designated storage locations within the warehouse.  Finally, the inventory levels in the system are updated to reflect the received stock, marking the completion of the restocking process for that item.

This process begins when an employee or a customer submits an incident report, detailing a technical issue or a workplace safety concern.  The submitted report is then logged into an incident tracking system. Following log entry, the incident report is assigned to the appropriate team based on the nature of the incident. The assigned team initiates an investigation by gathering necessary information related to the reported incident.  The team then analyzes the gathered information to identify the root cause of the incident. Based on the root cause analysis, the team proposes corrective actions to address the incident.  Subsequently, the proposed solution is implemented. This implementation may involve implementing a technical fix, conducting training sessions, or implementing a policy change. After the implementation of the corrective actions, a follow-up assessment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the solution and to ensure that the incident will not recur.  If the follow-up assessment is satisfactory, the incident report is closed. Upon closure of the incident report, all stakeholders involved in the incident, including the initial reporter and the assigned team, are notified of the resolution. The process ends when all stakeholders have been notified.

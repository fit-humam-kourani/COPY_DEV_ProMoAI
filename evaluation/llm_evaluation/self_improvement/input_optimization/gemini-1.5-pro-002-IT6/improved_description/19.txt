The process begins when a user logs in to their account to initiate an order.  Subsequently, the user selects the items they wish to purchase and concurrently sets their desired payment method. Following item selection, the user chooses a free reward from multiple available options. The reward selection is dependent on the total purchase value but is independent of the payment process.  Next, the user proceeds to payment.  There is an exclusive choice between making a direct payment or completing an installment agreement. After payment is processed, the selected items are delivered to the user. Following delivery, the user has the option to return items for exchange.  For each return initiated by the user, a new delivery of the exchanged items is performed.
